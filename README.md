# Crunchbase Explorer
Explore Crunchbase company data using Crossfilter visualization

[Live Demo](https://crunchbase-explorer.web.app)

## Usage
This visualization is based on [dc.js](https://dc-js.github.io/dc.js/), which allows you to explore large datasets by filtering on multiple dimensions at the same time. In other words, you can mix and match filters by clicking on each chart.

You can reset any filter by clicking on "reset" or clicking again on the selected filter.

## Setup

Coded using pure HTML / CSS / JS. Just fire up a webserver, and load index.html.
