# Crunchbase Explorer
Explore Crunchbase company data using Crossfilter visualization

[Live Demo](https://crunchbase-explorer.web.app)

## Usage
This visualization is based on [dc.js](https://dc-js.github.io/dc.js/), which allows you to explore large datasets by filtering on multiple dimensions at the same time. In other words, you can mix and match these filters:
* Click on map to filter by state
* Click on pie to filter by funding type
* Drag on bar chart to filter by time
* Click on bubble to filter by sector

You can reset any filter by clicking on "reset" or clicking on the selected filter.

## Setup

Coded using pure HTML / CSS / JS. Just fire up a webserver, and load index.html.
